This piece of code is a a shopping website.

Imagine entering a mall with different shops - that's the "Navigation". It guides you to various sections like the "Home", the "Shop", the "Checkout", and the "Authentication" (which is probably where you sign in or create an account). Each of these is like a different store in the mall.

When you first enter, the system checks if you've visited before and if you're still logged in from a previous visit. This is the "checkUserSession" part.

While the website is preparing each store for you to visit, it shows you a "Spinner". This is like a friendly assistant keeping you company while the store is being prepared for you.

Finally, the "GlobalStyle" is like the general decor of the mall, setting the look and feel throughout the website to make it a pleasant experience for you.

Everything works smoothly, just keep in mind to update the stripe.js file with the API of your actual Stripe account so it works like charm.
